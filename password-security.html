        <h2>Password Security</h2>
        <p>Your password is the first line of defense against unauthorized access. Here’s how to keep your passwords secure:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Create Long and Complex Passwords:</strong> The longer and more complex your password, the harder it is to crack. Use a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.</li>
            <li><strong>Avoid Reusing Passwords:</strong> Never reuse passwords across multiple sites. If one account gets compromised, others could be at risk.</li>
            <li><strong>Use a Password Manager:</strong> A password manager can securely store and generate strong passwords, helping you avoid the risk of remembering weak or reused passwords.</li>
            <li><strong>Change Passwords Regularly:</strong> Changing passwords periodically can minimize the chances of them being exposed over time.</li>
            <li><strong>Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):</strong> Even if someone obtains your password, 2FA provides an additional layer of protection by requiring a second form of verification.</li>
            <li><strong>Don’t Share Your Password:</strong> Never share your password over email, phone, or messaging apps. Keep it private and only use secure methods to change or store it.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Why Password Security is Essential:</h3>
        <p>In today’s digital world, your password is one of the most important security measures. A compromised password can lead to identity theft, loss of personal data, and even financial loss. Strong password practices are critical for maintaining privacy and security.</p>
