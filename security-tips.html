        <h2>Security Tips</h2>
        <p>Online security is critical in today's world. Here are key strategies to help you stay safe:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Use Strong Passwords:</strong> Your passwords should be long, unique, and difficult to guess. Avoid using obvious choices like "123456" or "password."</li>
            <li><strong>Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):</strong> Add an extra layer of protection by requiring a second form of authentication, such as a text message or authenticator app.</li>
            <li><strong>Update Your Software Regularly:</strong> Keep all your devices and applications up to date to protect against known vulnerabilities and malware.</li>
            <li><strong>Avoid Public Wi-Fi for Sensitive Transactions:</strong> Public Wi-Fi networks are often not secure. Use a Virtual Private Network (VPN) when accessing sensitive information on public networks.</li>
            <li><strong>Be Cautious with Email Links:</strong> Phishing emails often trick you into clicking malicious links. Always verify the sender's information and avoid clicking on suspicious links.</li>
            <li><strong>Backup Your Data:</strong> Regularly backup important data to ensure that even in case of an attack, you can recover your files.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Why these tips matter:</h3>
        <p>By adopting these tips, you significantly reduce the risk of falling victim to online threats. Cybersecurity is a shared responsibility, and the more precautions you take, the safer you'll be online.</p>
