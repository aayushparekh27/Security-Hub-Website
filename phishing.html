        <h2>Phishing Awareness</h2>
        <p>Phishing is one of the most common types of cyber-attacks. Learn how to recognize phishing attempts and protect yourself:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>What is Phishing?</strong> Phishing is a method of tricking individuals into divulging confidential information by masquerading as a trustworthy entity, typically via email or websites that appear legitimate.</li>
            <li><strong>Signs of a Phishing Email:</strong> Look out for emails that:
                <ul>
                    <li>Contain grammatical errors or odd phrasing.</li>
                    <li>Ask for personal information like passwords or credit card numbers.</li>
                    <li>Contain suspicious links or attachments.</li>
                    <li>Claim urgency, such as "Immediate action required!" or "Your account is at risk!"</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Don’t Click on Unknown Links:</strong> Always hover your cursor over a link to check its URL before clicking. If the URL seems suspicious or doesn’t match the source, do not click it.</li>
            <li><strong>Verify the Sender:</strong> If an email claims to be from a reputable source but seems off, verify the sender by contacting them directly using a known method (e.g., official phone number or website).</li>
            <li><strong>Use Anti-Phishing Tools:</strong> Many email clients and web browsers now include anti-phishing features that warn you about suspicious websites. Enable these features to add another layer of protection.</li>
            <li><strong>Report Suspicious Activity:</strong> If you suspect you’ve received a phishing email, report it to the relevant authorities or organizations, such as your email provider or the company being impersonated.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Why Phishing Awareness is Important:</h3>
        <p>Phishing scams are highly effective and can lead to identity theft, financial loss, and malware infections. By staying aware and cautious, you can prevent falling victim to these attacks.</p>
